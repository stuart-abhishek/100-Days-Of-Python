## 💻 Day 1 — Hello World Program 💻

### 🔹 Project Title
**Hello World Program** — My first Python code to print a simple message and start my 100 Days of Python journey.

### 🔹 Project Description
This is my first ever Python program — the classic “Hello World!” script.  
It’s simple, but it marks the official start of my Python learning adventure.  
The goal of this project was to understand how to run a Python script, use the `print()` function, and gain confidence writing code for the first time.

### 🔹 Concepts Used
- Basic Syntax  
- `print()` function  
- Strings and text output  
- Comment usage (`#`)  
- Understanding how Python executes code  

### 🔹 Code Snippet
```python
