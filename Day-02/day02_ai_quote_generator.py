# Some smart quotes with placeholders

    f"Success doesnâ€™t come from what you do occasionally, {name}, it comes from what you do consistently for {goal}.",
    f"{name}, when you feel like quitting, think about why you started {goal}.",
    f"The future belongs to those like {name} who never stop learning while chasing {goal}.",
    f"{name}, small steps every day towards {goal} will lead to massive results."
